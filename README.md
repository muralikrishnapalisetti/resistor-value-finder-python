# ğŸŸ« Resistor Value Finder Tool ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦

This Python project helps you **instantly calculate the resistance value** of a 4-band color-coded resistor. No more manual decoding or flipping through charts!

## ğŸ’¡ Features

- Input 4 resistor color bands (e.g., red, violet, brown, gold)
- Instantly get the resistance value in ohms and tolerance
- Simple command-line interface
- Educational for EEE students and beginners

## ğŸš€ How It Works

1. Run the program
2. Enter the 4 color bands (from left to right)
3. Get the resistance value instantly!

## ğŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Dictionaries
- Functions
- String handling
